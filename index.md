## Scraping Reddit Data

This small project takes a look at reddit data utilizing the Reddit API and the PRAW package. Reddit is a highly popular social media website centered around smaller clumps of communities called "subreddits" centered on a particular topic - whether it's general topics like cooking or politics or even niche communities. Inevitably, this may lead to fragmented communities that become echo chambers, like r/conservative which is frequented by conservative-minded people. Alternatively, subreddits can become heavily contested by users with a variety of opinions. Reddit traditionally has a western audience, but has begun to become increasingly global in its userbase. 

Through this project, we can visualize and analyze Reddit posts and comments in a similar vein to review websites and social media. The challenge lies in sifting through the myriad of comments that do not necessarily reflect user sentiment.
